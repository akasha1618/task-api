"intermittent service on configair server in SID_34 requires probably a restart on production server. 
the error occurs in production and shows ""500 internal serrver error. error: while trying to invoke the method java.util.list.iterator() of null object loaded from local variable 'local list'""
the issue can be reproduced in production e.g.:
a) company customer e.g.# 81510728 and base material mm3716934 (hss/pm finishing)
b) company customer e.g. .# 81510728 and starting from scratch. i can select a product platform e.g. hp hss/pm roughing, but the screen freezes.
c) log-on language different ""en"", e.g. ""de"". company customer e.g. 81124199; base material e.g. 5157483. 
we had this issues already several times before and it needed always a restart of the server. thryeu is a good contact person for this issue as he was already working on the root cause with our external vendor configair.

"hi all

we have a connectivity issue between erp pi and msd crm due to certificate renewal on azure websites and that certificate is not yet updated on erp pi side.

issue: changes to data records (accounts, sales area data, partner functions, contacts, leads) are not being processed from erp pi to 
worked with IT


msd crm and vice versa in all environments (prod, qa and dev).
issue start time: 24th oct ~8:15pm

troubleshooting steps: 
1. when tryhdty from customer master team reported the issue that a prospect account created in erp didn't come into msd yet â€“ erp pi team observed that the records are in ""still awaiting acknowledgement"" status â€“ which basically means they are not yet delivered/received by the target system.
2. upon some log analysis and trying to identify the root cause between erp pi, basis and msd teams â€“ it's been observed that the issue has started in production environment since around 8:15pm est on 24th oct.
3. we observed the same behavior with azure mfg_tool and erp pi logs of other non-production environments as well.
4. you can find error screenshots from erp pi system in the mail chain.

root cause: it appears that the certificate for azure webapps have been updated on 29th sept 2016 as it is nearing the expiration date (11th jan 2017). but the new certificate is not updated on erp pi (they are not even aware of this change!). so, when the production azure webapp (company-crm-sp-mfg_toolt.azurewebsites.net) got restarted on 24th oct around 8:15pm â€“ this connectivity appears to have been broken.

next steps: 
1. we need the azure webapp certificate chain to be sent to erp basis team so that they can update it on erp pi system. whom can i reach out to for receiving the certificate details? do we have an azure admin in house or do you want me to open a case with microsoft?
2. once certificate is received, maybe we can first do this on qa system and then upon confirmation that it works, we can apply it to production and other environments.

Dear Support Team,

I'm encountering a problem that I hope you can assist me with. Below are the details:

gentles,

i have two devices that are trying to share an ip address. they are trying to share 96.26.27.9619. one is a printer with the hostname of prtjc0074, and the other is a new display for erp. the display is using dhcp to get its address assigned and the printer is hard coded.

my guess is that the address 96.26.27.9619 did not get set to a static address in dhcp. i need this corrected so the display will pick up another address.

I'm looking forward to your assistance with this issue.

hi -

the printer01 printer is not working and needs a part replaced.  can you reroute the jobs in queue to printer printer02?   wihuyjdo qpogfwkb has indicated that prqos001 needs a new part and it may not deliver for a few days so the inwarehouse_tools will need to print on printer02 for now.  this needs to be taken care of today since the inwarehouse_tools are printed and are picked up by an outside vendor at 2:30 pm in usa on a daily basis.   please contact dkmcfreg anwmfvlgenkataramdntyana if you have questions about the jobs in queue for today.

hello,

till last week i was accessing bex reports using mms portal and there were no issues.

starting this week the system is incredibly slow when i log in and finally does not allow me to access any reports.

can it be the issue with any maintenance or my access rights or rather i should try to access bex using different way?

below the print screen from what i see after log in:
[cid:image001.png@01d2310c.f184b360]

i am also able to get to finance reports (see below), however when i click ""profitability analysis"" (as i was always doing) separate window is open however apart rom that the screen is blank.

Dear Support Team,

I'm encountering a problem that I hope you can assist me with. Below are the details:

hello,

bahdqrcs xvgzdtqj was an intern that we hired on full-time effective aug. 16th. we followed the process of having her old manager transfer her to her new manager in oneteam and then her new manager entered her new job and compensation information like he's been instructed to. however, i have to be honest, her onbankrding experience has been a disaster so far. she says that every time she calls hrss to help her out, they are not very helpful or resolve her issues. hrss will tell her it's an ""it problem"" and it will tell her that it's an ""hr problem."" here are some of the issues that she's still having:


1.      no access to benefit information on collaboration_tool â€“ when she follows the directions that she was given, she gets an error message that says ""needs approval, request has been submitted.""

2.      no ethics access

3.      no expense report access â€“ she was able to enter her expense report, however when she went to submit it she got an error message and now when she tries to log-in, she gets an error message. it said that this is an it problem.

4.      no access to the vpn â€“ again, it said that hr needs to update the SID_34? i'm not really sure what that is.

5.      incorrect paychecks â€“ she did not receive a paycheck on 8/30. i told her that depending when her information was processed, payroll might not have caught the fact that she's salary now and then it should all be corrected on her 9/15 paycheck. sharee emailed her yesterday and made it sound like everything was going to be corrected on her 9/15 paycheck, but then sent a follow-up email saying that because u2 already ran, she was not going to be able to backdate and the effective date for this change was going to have to be 9/1. she wants liuytre to provide her hours worked from 8/18 â€“ 8/31. this is not going to work because liuytre stopped tracking her hours since she is now a salaried employee. she was also at a company conference the week of 8/22 and ""technically"" worked way more than 40 hours that week because she was part of meetings, dinners and after hours' team building activities.

can someone from it and shared services be her ""designated"" contact and work with her through these issues until everything is figured out? if something is an it issue, can hrss follow-up with it so she's not being passed back and forth? she is beyond frustrated and only has until next friday to figure out her benefits before her eligibility timeframdntye is up.

I'm looking forward to your assistance with this issue.

"the geengineering_tooloductdata web service calls the design_tool service to obtain cad models for engineering_tool.
i believe this link points to the design_tool uacyltoe hxgaycze service: 

looks like the naming convention has changed in the last few days and files returned by this service are being named with just the materials_management number.
(e.g. mm 7304975 in SID_34. see the attached fw  engineering_tool drills.msg for more details)

the change is causing issues with models not being returned to  engineering_tool.
engineering_tool will be demoed at imts starting on monday the 12th. 
need an urgent fix to revert any changes that might have been made to the file naming convention for files from the design_tool service.

below are the original rules uli had implemented for file names for cad files returned by this service.
here are the implemented naming rules:

â€¢ if there is a cad_catalog_iso it's taken, 
o else if there is a cad_catalog_ansi it's taken,
ï‚§ else rqfhiong zkwfqagb is taken
â€¢ an underscore plus cad_graph_type is added 
â€¢ finally the original file extension is added

i am approfghaching you, as we have problems with our approval workflow for credit memo requests respectively rmas.
i opened several tickets regarding this topic, which unfortunately did not lead to a final solution.
maybe it is a (erp-) language problem for my part.
anyway, i  hope, that you can help to get this fixed.

the approval levels for our organization are as follows (regardless who is the sales person in customer account)
level 1 (1.000â‚¬-4.999â‚¬): jwqyxbzs adpvilqu (afcbrhqw vudghzcb as subsitute, if possible)
level 2 (5.000â‚¬-9.999â‚¬): jwqyxbzs adpvilqu (afcbrhqw vudghzcb as substitute if possible)
level 3 (10.000â‚¬-24.999â‚¬): qsoxltny dzjespml (tjnwdauo jkdwbhgs as substitute if possible)
level 4 (25.000â‚¬ plus): michghytuael rÃ¼nz (tjnwdauo jkdwbhgs as substitute if possible)

it often happens, that these workflows are routed to the wrong person.
lauacyltoe hxgaycze example: rma 7611183856 was routed to me at level 1 and approved, but then to jmkcewds qkoipbzn at level 2, wo has nothing to do with it.

it takes a lot of time, to gather the wrong routed workflows and to forward them to the responsible person.

i appreciate your help.

"hello,

it please advise the status on the below request.

hi nafghyncy,

agbighyail espinosa appears to be an active employee.  after all, she entered a bunch of sales orders in erp ecc over the last few days.  yet there is a central block on her employee account in erp crm so that it does not show up in the search results when we search for employee accounts using ""role is employee"".  unless you already know the reason for this, would you please check with hr why her account has a central block on it?  it seems like it could possibly be an error.

tor activity does not immediately indicate malicious activity, however the presence of anonymizing software should be investigated to determine if this is authorized or expected activity. tor activity indicates a possible policy violation which in turn could lead to a potential compromise. tor is being increasingly used by malware, therefore tor activity may also indicate a malware infection.

betreff: open order schedule lines_p2016-08-28-22-03-54

hello.

this report is your weekly open order schedule lines report.  it lists all scheduled delivery dates for open orders for your customers. 

it is expected that you will use this report to effectively manage your sales territory.

if you have any questions with regard to the report please contact your regional sales operational excellence lead.

how to read this report
all scheduled order items are listed on the report.  the columns with the purple field names show total values for that line on the order, and should not be added together.  these total values will appear on every scheduled line.  in the example below, a line item has a total quantity ordered = 10 pieces and three scheduled deliveries of 1, 2 and 7 pieces.  the report will repeat the total quantity ordered = 10 on every schedule line:

order nbr    item nbr    create date     qty sched     value sched    date sched    unit price    qty order

i am requesting for dock station and add-on monitor (preferably bigger in size). please consider this request and assist.

 - helps me with my various work related activities like inwarehouse_tool comparison so i can do it in much more effective way with add-on monitor
 - also helps me in email activities
 - last but not the least, i don't have to carry my laptop charger to office everyday and can make my laptop big bit more lighter ;)

incident overview
=========================
we are seeing '51551 vid67965 microsoft windows httpsys rce vulnerability exploit attempt (ms15-034 cve-2015-1635) - mapp' alerts being generated by your isensplant_247.company.com/208.211.136.207 device indicating that one or more hosts, including 198.8.80.219, are attempting to exploit the microsoft windows http.sys remote code execution vulnerability (cve-2015-1635/ms15-034) on one or more of your internet-facing hosts, including 208.211.136.164/208.211.136.164,. successful exploitation of this vulnerability may result in a denial of service condition or remote code execution on vulnerable systems. 

we are escalating this incident to you via a high severity/full escalation master ticket for all unblocked events related to this vulnerability (i.e. we are creating a singular ticket for all inbound threats related to this vulnerability). this ticket will effectively serve as a master ticket for any related events until we receive feedback from you on how to handle these events going forward. 

it should be noted that blocking each source ip address may not necessarily be productive due to attackers' ability to switch ip addresses through the use of proxies, anonymizing software such as tor, and vpns. please investigate your environment to determine whether you are running a vulnerable version of the application being targeted and ensure that you are running the most recent non-vulnerable version of windows, and that your devices are patched and properly hardened against attacks.

if you would like these events handled differently, please let us know either by corresponding to us via this ticket and delegating the ticket back to the soc, or by calling us at . we have a number of options available for the handling of future alerts such as this one:
1) autoresolve any events related to attacks against the microsoft windows http.sys kernel driver directly to the portal (no explicit notification and events will be available for reporting purposes in the portal). this is most likely the best choice if you are not running the application being targeted or if you are running a non-vulnerable version of the application
2) ticket only escalation via a medium priority ticket (no phone call) for each unique source ip address for attacks against the microsoft windows http.sys kernel driver (this may generate a relatively large volume of incident tickets)
3) full escalation via a high priority ticket and a phone call for each unique source ip address for attacks against the microsoft windows http.sys kernel driver (this may generate a relatively large volume of incident tickets)"

=========================
technical details
=========================
remote procedure call (rpc), also known as the loovexfbjy lmcaqfkz (loc-srv), is a microsoft windows protocol that allows an application to to execute code in another address space (commonly on another computer on a shared network) without the programdntymer explicitly coding the details for this remote interaction. that is, the programdntymer writes germanytially the same code whether the subroutine is local to the executing programdnty, or remote. 

an rpc is initiated by the client, which sends a request message to a known remote server to execute a specified procedure with supplied paramdntyeters. the remote server sends a response to the client, and the application continues its process. rpc runs on port 135, and is used in client/server applications (such as microsoft exchange clients, mgermanyger service, dhcp server, dns server, wins, as well as other windows applications). vulnerabilities in rpc have also been leveraged by several worms as a means for propagation. examples include:
-w32.blaster.worm/msblast/lovsan 
-w32.welchia/nachi
-w32.reatle

"we have some consultants from ca technologies visiting this week and i used the following website to provide them access to the companyguest wifi network:


i see a certificate error for this site in ie and chrome. (see attached screenshot)

i ignored the error and logged in to create a couple of accounts yesterday.
given that account credentials are limited to a max of 1 day, i went in today and tried to ""edit"" the accounts to change the date for today.
everything looked okay in the web app but users were not able to login.

i even tried to reset the password for one of the users but that didn't help either.

it is cumbersome to re-type the same info and create new accounts for each day.
it would be great if the certificate issues are taken care of and accounts could be created for multiple days( or it is easier to renew passwords)

hello chandruhdty, ebi,

iÂ´ve created an example in SID_1 for debugging an fixing. production order to receive is 226138271 // mm# 4289785.
the issue does not only appear in case the user tries to ship against a planned order but also when trying to ship against a production order.

shipping against planned orders:

it looks like zpdist_programdnty does only allow to ship against planned orders in case the planned order finish date is due or past due (purple example in the screenshot). in case the planned order finish date is not due (red example) zpdist_programdnty does not allow to ship against the planned order.

the following things need to be changed:

- zpdist_programdnty should allow to force the shipment against planned orders even though the planned order is not due (just like zpdist_programdnty does for stock transfer orders)
- zpdist_programdnty should use the planned order start date rather than the planned order finish date to determine whether the planned order is due

shipping against production orders:

it looks like zpdist_programdnty does only allow to ship against production orders in case the basic finish date of the production order is due or past due (blue example). in case the basic finish date of the production order is not due (yellow example) zpdist_programdnty does not allow to ship against the production order.

the following things need to be changed:

- zpdist_programdnty should allow to force the shipment against production orders even though the production order is not due (just like zpdist_programdnty does for stock transfer orders)
- zpdist_programdnty should use the basic start date (which is already shown in the transaction) rather than the basic finish date to determine whether the production order is due"

"hello, 

i have two specific cases where a newly created prospect account in crm (modern construction and sandfield engineering) does not get an erp number, even after some days. after having run an advanced find search i found we have 385 such cases. please see attached file that describes the issue and the unique steps. 

if prospects do not get an erp id it results in the fact that they do not show up in the usersÂ´""my active prospects"" view because it filters on prospects with erp id. users think that the account was not created and create the over and over again. we should review if we want to change the logic behind this view - i assume the filter was put in to exlude non-complete accounts. 

another issue i found during this troubleshooting process is i deactivated such a duplicate prospect and the audit log shows that 5 minutes later the account got activated again and got the erp number, too. please investigate this one too.

it looks like me may still have a web issue.  the folks at the warehouse have seen some instances where the carrier has been a carrier tcode but the inco & sc were cip & 10 so kis is trying to change it to ups ground.  in one case it looks like the inco & sc are pulling from the sold to & the carrier is coming from the ship-to and in another it looks like the customer changed the carrier but was flat rate already because i didn't see that carrier option listed as a default on either the sold to or ship to

incident overview
=========================
we are seeing your 10.32.100.17/isensor03.company.com device generating '51793 vid36000 server response with anubis sinkhole cookies set - probable infected asset' alerts for traffic (not blocked) from port 80/tcp of 195.38.137.100 to port 3720/tcp of your lpawx210968sf/61.01.52.02617 device indicating that the host is most likely infected with malware. 

this return traffic indicates that lpawx210968sf/61.01.52.02617 has most likely attempted to visit a domain name which is being sinkholed. dns sinkholes are dns servers that give out false information in order to prevent the use of the domain for which ip address resolution has been requested. sinkhole traffic is a possible indicator of an infected computer that is reaching out to a controller that has been taken over by a law enforcement or research organization as part of a malware mitigation effort. traffic to a sinkhole should be examined for characteristics of automated activity. in some cases, an administrator may be curious about a particular domain and browse to it, triggering the signature. repeated automated requests to a sinkhole, however, are a clear indication of a malware infection.

we are escalating this incident to you via a high priority ticket per our default escalation policies. if you would like us to handle these incidents differently in the future (see below for handling options), or if you have any further questions or concerns, please let us know either by corresponding to us via this ticket and delegating the ticket back to the soc, or by calling us at . 
1) ticket only escalation for sinkhole domain alerts (explicit notification via a medium priority ticket (no phone call))
2) auto-resolve sinkhole domain alerts directly to the portal (no explicit notification but events will be available for reporting purposes in the portal)

sincerely,
secureworks soc


=========================
technical details
=========================
the domain name system (dns) is a hierarchical naming system for any resource connected to the internet or a private network which has the primary purpose of associating various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. it is primarily used for translating domain names to the numerirtcal ip addresses for the purpose of locating service and devices on a network. 

the domain name system distributes the responsibility of assigning domain names and mapping those names to ip addresses by designating authoritative name servers for each domain. authoritative name servers are assigned to be responsible for their supported domains, and may delegate authority over subdomains to other name servers. the domain name system also specifies the technical functionality of this database service. it defines the dns protocol, a detailed specification of the data structures and data communication exchanges used in dns, as part of the internet protocol suite.

dns sinkholes are dns servers that give out incorrect information in order to prevent the use of the domain name for which ip address resolution is being attempted. when a client requests to resolve the address of a sinkholed hole or domain, the sinkhole returns a non-routable address or any address except for the real address. this germanytially denies the client a connection to the target host. using this method, compromised clients can easily be found using sinkhole logs. another method of detecting compromised hosts is during operations in which servers being used for c2 (command and control) purposes are taken over by law enforcement as part of a malware mitigation effort. traffic to a sinkhole should be examined for characteristics of automated activity. in some cases, an administrator may be curious about a particular domain and browse to it, triggering the signature. repeated automated requests to a sinkhole are a clear indication of infection by a trojan of some sort.

connections to sinkholes may seem somewhat benign, but the ramdntyifications certainly include information leakage to some extent. although sinkhole operators are unlikely to use any personally identifiable information they may capture from a trojan's communication, it may become public knowledge that ""company x is infected with y"", which may lead to reputational damage.

additionally, some sinkholes are feeding ip addresses of victims to beshryulists, which may impede access to certain services, like sending email. finally, some trojans may connect to multiple controller domains/hostnames, and even though some of them may be sinkholed, there may be others that are not, leading to the possibility of remote code execution or information leakage to malicious parties in some cases.

incident overview
=========================
we are seeing your 10.32.100.17/isensor03.company.com device generating '51793 vid36000 server response with anubis sinkhole cookies set - probable infected asset' alerts for traffic (not blocked) from port 80/tcp of 195.38.137.100 to port 3720/tcp of your lpawx210968sf/61.01.52.02617 device indicating that the host is most likely infected with malware. 

this return traffic indicates that lpawx210968sf/61.01.52.02617 has most likely attempted to visit a domain name which is being sinkholed. dns sinkholes are dns servers that give out false information in order to prevent the use of the domain for which ip address resolution has been requested. sinkhole traffic is a possible indicator of an infected computer that is reaching out to a controller that has been taken over by a law enforcement or research organization as part of a malware mitigation effort. traffic to a sinkhole should be examined for characteristics of automated activity. in some cases, an administrator may be curious about a particular domain and browse to it, triggering the signature. repeated automated requests to a sinkhole, however, are a clear indication of a malware infection.

we are escalating this incident to you via a high priority ticket per our default escalation policies. if you would like us to handle these incidents differently in the future (see below for handling options), or if you have any further questions or concerns, please let us know either by corresponding to us via this ticket and delegating the ticket back to the soc, or by calling us at . 
1) ticket only escalation for sinkhole domain alerts (explicit notification via a medium priority ticket (no phone call))
2) auto-resolve sinkhole domain alerts directly to the portal (no explicit notification but events will be available for reporting purposes in the portal)

sincerely,
secureworks soc


=========================
technical details
=========================
the domain name system (dns) is a hierarchical naming system for any resource connected to the internet or a private network which has the primary purpose of associating various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. it is primarily used for translating domain names to the numerirtcal ip addresses for the purpose of locating service and devices on a network. 

the domain name system distributes the responsibility of assigning domain names and mapping those names to ip addresses by designating authoritative name servers for each domain. authoritative name servers are assigned to be responsible for their supported domains, and may delegate authority over subdomains to other name servers. the domain name system also specifies the technical functionality of this database service. it defines the dns protocol, a detailed specification of the data structures and data communication exchanges used in dns, as part of the internet protocol suite.

dns sinkholes are dns servers that give out incorrect information in order to prevent the use of the domain name for which ip address resolution is being attempted. when a client requests to resolve the address of a sinkholed hole or domain, the sinkhole returns a non-routable address or any address except for the real address. this germanytially denies the client a connection to the target host. using this method, compromised clients can easily be found using sinkhole logs. another method of detecting compromised hosts is during operations in which servers being used for c2 (command and control) purposes are taken over by law enforcement as part of a malware mitigation effort. traffic to a sinkhole should be examined for characteristics of automated activity. in some cases, an administrator may be curious about a particular domain and browse to it, triggering the signature. repeated automated requests to a sinkhole are a clear indication of infection by a trojan of some sort.

connections to sinkholes may seem somewhat benign, but the ramdntyifications certainly include information leakage to some extent. although sinkhole operators are unlikely to use any personally identifiable information they may capture from a trojan's communication, it may become public knowledge that ""company x is infected with y"", which may lead to reputational damage.

additionally, some sinkholes are feeding ip addresses of victims to beshryulists, which may impede access to certain services, like sending email. finally, some trojans may connect to multiple controller domains/hostnames, and even though some of them may be sinkholed, there may be others that are not, leading to the possibility of remote code execution or information leakage to malicious parties in some cases.

=========================
technical details
=========================
locky is a new ransomware that encrypts your data using aes encryption and then demands a form of digital currency to decrypt your files. locky is distributed by malicious attachments to spam emails and recently seen in massive phishing campaigns with microsoft word document attachments. ctu researchers have observed attachments (for example, inwarehouse_tool_j-81076273.doc) with embedded macro code used to download the locky payload. filenames seem to be constructed by using eight random numbers following ""inwarehouse_tool_j-"". a potential victim receiving the attachment needs to open it and enable the macro which will then initiate the payload download over http.

once locky is running on the compromised system, it drops a copy of itself in the %temp% directory under the affected user's profile and sets a registry run key to ensure persistence across reboots. the dropped file has used the filenames ladybi.exe and svchost.exe. locky also sets the hkcu\software\locky registry key and creates the values listed in the ctu tips article provided in the references section. 

locky also checks for the following registry keys, which may indicate the presence of security-related software:
â€¢ software\kasperskylab
â€¢ software\eset
â€¢ software\avast software

the victim is notified of the infection when the desktop background image changes (see figure 4 in ctu tips). locky places the same instructions in a text file and a bitmap image on the desktop and displays both of these files to the victim.

there is unconfirmed speculation that the operators of the botnet distributing the locky malware are also responsible for the bugat v5 (dridex) banking trojan. the spam emanates from the same botnet that distributes bugat v5 and other threats such as the shiz/shifu malware, but this finding is not conclusive because the botnet is used by various affiliates at different times.

locky may also have the capability to locate network resources and encrypt files in those locations. ctu researchers are analysing a block of code that may be used to enumerate network-based locations (2016-02-19).

locky attempts encryption on the following files and file types:

=========================
technical details
=========================
locky is a new ransomware that encrypts your data using aes encryption and then demands a form of digital currency to decrypt your files. locky is distributed by malicious attachments to spam emails and recently seen in massive phishing campaigns with microsoft word document attachments. ctu researchers have observed attachments (for example, inwarehouse_tool_j-81076273.doc) with embedded macro code used to download the locky payload. filenames seem to be constructed by using eight random numbers following ""inwarehouse_tool_j-"". a potential victim receiving the attachment needs to open it and enable the macro which will then initiate the payload download over http.

once locky is running on the compromised system, it drops a copy of itself in the %temp% directory under the affected user's profile and sets a registry run key to ensure persistence across reboots. the dropped file has used the filenames ladybi.exe and svchost.exe. locky also sets the hkcu\software\locky registry key and creates the values listed in the ctu tips article provided in the references section. 

locky also checks for the following registry keys, which may indicate the presence of security-related software:
â€¢ software\kasperskylab
â€¢ software\eset
â€¢ software\avast software

the victim is notified of the infection when the desktop background image changes (see figure 4 in ctu tips). locky places the same instructions in a text file and a bitmap image on the desktop and displays both of these files to the victim.

there is unconfirmed speculation that the operators of the botnet distributing the locky malware are also responsible for the bugat v5 (dridex) banking trojan. the spam emanates from the same botnet that distributes bugat v5 and other threats such as the shiz/shifu malware, but this finding is not conclusive because the botnet is used by various affiliates at different times.

locky may also have the capability to locate network resources and encrypt files in those locations. ctu researchers are analysing a block of code that may be used to enumerate network-based locations (2016-02-19).

locky attempts encryption on the following files and file types:

one more thing to note is that reporting_tool maintains a count of emails sent per day but the count has not doubled indicating that smtp server seems to be processing it twice instead of reporting_tool sending them multiple times.

the issue has been escalate to higher management.

1.       jdlxkygf wlzqaivr: davidthd's former manager (and expense report approver), gergrythg bigleman, is no longer with the company. davidthd has an expense report in gergrythg's queue. 
2.       how does mikhghytr ramdntysey get access to that to approve and/or forward to the correct manager? 
3.       how can we ensure there are no other requests in gergrythg's universal worklist?
